<h1>Stratagus Palette Documentation</h1>
<hr>

Stratagus graphics use a 256 color palette.<p>

To see color indices, open the 'Indexed Palette' dialog in gimp.<p>

Some colors are fixed for specific usage as follows:<p>

<ul>
    <li>38-47 : Water Cycling. Or any other range as defined in the
	scripts with SetColorWaterCycleStart and SetColorWaterCycleEnd.
    <li>240-244 : Icon Cycling. Or any other range as defined in the
	scripts with SetColorIconCycleStart and SetColorIconCycleEnd.
    <li>205-207 : Building Cycling. Or any other range as defined in the
	scripts with SetColorBuildingCycleStart and SetColorBuildingCycleEnd.
    <li>208-211 : These are the player colors, going from lightest to
    darkest and will be replaced depending on the player color.
    <li>The remaining colors may be used as regular colors
</ul>

NOTE: the cycling applies to all images, eg, the building cycling
occurs for icons as well. The color cycling can be configured
from ccl eg, by editing the "SetColorWaterCycleStart(38)" line
you can set the start for the water cycling. Color cycling can
be disabled or enabled with "SetColorCycleAll".<p>

A sample palette, <a href="stratagus.gimp">stratagus.gimp</a>,
is included.<p>
